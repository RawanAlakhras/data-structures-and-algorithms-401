# Stacks and Queues

the program able to implement stack and queue using linked list 

## Challenge

* Create a Stack class that has a top property.
* The class should contain the following methods:
  * push:adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack.
  * pop:Returns the value from node from the top of the stack ,Removes the node from the top of the stack
  * peek : Returns: Value of the node located at the top of the stack
  * is empty :Returns: Boolean indicating whether or not the stack is empty.
* Create a Queue class that has a front property. 
* The class should contain the following methods:
  * enqueue:adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue
  * dequeue:Returns the value from node from the front of the queue Removes the node from the front of the queue
  * peek :Returns: Value of the node located at the front of the queue
  * is empty :Returns Boolean indicating whether or not the queue is empty


## Approach & Efficiency

* push method and enqueue:
  * Time O(1)
  * Space O(1)
* pop method and dequeue :
  * Time O(1)
  * Space O(1)
* peek method:
  * Time O(1)
  * Space O(1)
* is empty
  * Time O(1)
  * Space O(1)
